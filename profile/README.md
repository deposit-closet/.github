# Deposit Closet

## 🚀 About Us
We are a group of two individuals who decided to collaborate on financial analysis and visualization of interest rate patterns. With one eye on the frontend and the other on the backend, we are all about creating cool stuff to visualize intriguing interest rate trends.

## 📁 Repositories

1. **BackBond** - [Repo Link](https://github.com/deposit-closet/BackBond) 
    - This repository is cenetered around the backend transactional details of the project. 
    - It serves information on interest rates directly to the frontend while also running other services such as an auto update feature which makes sure the database is up to date.
